title: "China and India Dominate Global Coal Expansion: 87% of New Capacity in 2025"
summary: "While the world desperately needs to phase out coal, China and India are moving in the opposite direction. New data shows these two countries account for 87% of all new coal power capacity in the first half of 2025, with China alone responsible for 75 GW of newly proposed plants. This massive expansion locks in decades more emissions just when rapid decarbonization is most critical."

The climate crisis demands rapid coal phase-out, but the world's two most populous countries are heading in the opposite direction. New analysis from Carbon Brief reveals a sobering reality: **China and India accounted for 87% of all new coal power capacity in the first half of 2025**.

## ⚡ The Staggering Scale

The numbers paint a dire picture for global climate goals:

- **China dominates across all stages:** 74.7 GW newly proposed, 46 GW started construction, 21.3 GW started operating
- **India continues expansion:** 12.8 GW newly proposed, 1.6 GW started construction, 5.1 GW started operating
- **Rest of world minimal:** Just 11 GW newly proposed globally outside China and India

To put this in perspective, China alone proposed more new coal capacity (74.7 GW) in six months than most countries have in total installed capacity.

## Why This Is Climate Catastrophe

**Lock-in Effect:** Every new coal plant built today will operate for 30-40+ years, pumping out emissions well past 2060. These aren't just numbers - they represent gigatons of future CO2 that make 1.5°C warming impossible.

**Momentum Problem:** Once built, coal plants create powerful economic incentives to keep running. The massive investments being made now will resist future closure efforts.

**Global Impact:** China and India represent nearly 40% of global population. Their energy choices don't just affect them - they determine whether humanity can avoid catastrophic climate change.

## The Timing Couldn't Be Worse

This expansion comes exactly when climate science demands the opposite. The IPCC is clear: to limit warming to 1.5°C, global coal use must fall by 75% by 2030. Instead, the world's largest countries are doubling down.

> While renewable capacity is also growing rapidly in both countries, the sheer scale of new coal infrastructure being built today will haunt climate efforts for decades to come.

## What This Means for Climate Goals

Every gigawatt of new coal capacity makes global climate targets harder to reach. With China and India building at this scale, the mathematics of staying below 2°C warming become increasingly challenging.

The world can build all the solar and wind it wants, but if coal capacity keeps expanding at this pace, emissions will continue rising. This isn't just a climate policy failure - it's a reality check on how far we still are from the energy transition the planet desperately needs.

The question isn't whether renewables are growing (they are), but whether they're growing fast enough to offset this coal expansion. Based on these numbers, the answer is deeply troubling.
