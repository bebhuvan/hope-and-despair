summary: "While humanity has cleared one-third of global forests over 10,000 years, deforestation peaked in the 1980s and is now declining. With agricultural innovation and changing land use patterns, a future with more people AND more forest is actually possible."

Yes, we've lost a staggering amount of forest - about one-third of all forests that existed 10,000 years ago are now gone. That's an area twice the size of the United States that has been cleared for agriculture and development.

But here's what's changing: deforestation actually peaked in the 1980s and has been declining ever since. We're turning a corner.

## Why There's Hope

The key insight is that agricultural land use per person has more than halved over the past 50 years. We're growing more food on less land thanks to improved crop yields and farming techniques.

> In fact, the world [may have already passed](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/agricultural-land?tab=chart&stackMode=absolute&region=World) 'peak agricultural land' [we will look at this in more detail in an upcoming post]. And with the growth of technological innovations such as lab-grown meat and substitute products, there is the real possibility that we can continue to enjoy meat or meat-like foods while freeing up the massive amounts of land we use to raise livestock.
