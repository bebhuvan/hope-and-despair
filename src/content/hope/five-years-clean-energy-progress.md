summary: "Solar power has achieved unprecedented scaling speeds, doubling from 1,000 TWh to 2,000 TWh in just three years. With renewables providing 48% of EU electricity and China surpassing 2030 targets six years early, the clean energy transition is accelerating faster than ever - though electrification of energy demand remains a critical blind spot."

Five years into the accelerating clean energy transition, the numbers tell a story of unprecedented progress - and reveal critical strategic gaps that could determine whether we seize this historic moment.

## Solar Power's Unprecedented Scaling

Solar power has become the undisputed champion of energy transition. The scaling speed is simply remarkable: after taking eight years to grow from 100 TWh to 1,000 TWh, solar **doubled again to 2,000 TWh in just three additional years** by 2024.

No other electricity source in history has ever scaled this quickly. Solar has been the largest source of new electricity globally for three consecutive years, and with battery costs plummeting, it's evolving from a daytime-only resource into a 24-hour backbone of the global energy system.

## Regional Leaders Setting the Pace

</div>

The transition shows dramatic regional differences across Asia:

- **China's record-breaking year:** Added 278 GW of solar and 80 GW of wind in 2024 - equivalent to 1.5 times Germany's total installed capacity
- **Surpassing 2030 targets six years early:** China's total wind and solar capacity exceeded 1,400 GW, enabling clean electricity to meet over 80% of incremental power demand
- **India's acceleration:** Ranks third globally in renewables deployment, with wind and solar generation nearly doubling between 2020-2024

## Europe's Historic Milestone

Europe achieved a breakthrough moment with renewables providing **48% of EU electricity in 2024**, up from just one-third in 2019. Solar became the EU's largest electricity source for the first time in June 2025, with sixteen countries generating over 10% of their electricity from solar - well above the 7% global average.

## The Critical Strategic Gap

Here's where the story gets concerning: while most countries are racing ahead with renewable deployment, few are prioritizing electrification of energy demand. This represents a significant strategic blind spot.

> China is growing electricity's share of final energy by 10 percentage points per decade, while Europe and the US have seen minimal progress for a generation. This represents a significant strategic error, as electrification can reduce energy imports by three-quarters and deliver greater household savings.

Electrification isn't just about climate - it's essential for economic and energy security advantages in an increasingly competitive global transition.

## Innovation in Monitoring

The report introduces innovative satellite technology for tracking methane emissions from coal, oil, and gas operations. However, environmental conditions like cloud cover and challenging terrain affect monitoring at nearly one-third of fossil fuel sites worldwide, highlighting the need for complementary ground-based measurements.

The message is clear: the clean energy transition is accelerating faster than many expected, but realizing its full potential requires coordinated scaling of batteries, smart grids, flexible demand technologies - and most critically, aggressive electrification strategies.
